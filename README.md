This is the [Basic Fantasy RPG](https://www.basicfantasy.org/) system for FoundryVTT.

## Installation

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orffen/basicfantasyrpg/main/system.json

## Usage

### Initiative

Initiative automatically includes the character's Dexterity modifier. The character sheet has a field for Initiative Bonus which can be used to add the Halfling's initiative bonus, or any bonuses from magic items.

The system does not yet automatically reset initiative at the end of each combat round, but this can be manually done in FoundryVTT's initiative tracker.

### Monster Special Abilities

The monster sheet has a "special abilities" field. This field should be 0, 1, or 2, depending on how many asterisks appear after the monster's hit dice value. XP values for monsters are automatically calculated.
